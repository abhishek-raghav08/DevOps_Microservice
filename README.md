## Project Overview

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. 

You are given a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, `app.py`—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

### Project Tasks

Your project goal is to operationalize this working, machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project you will:
* Test your project code using linting
* 
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* 
* Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* 
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* 
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* 
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* 
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested

You can find a detailed [project rubric, here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2576/view).

**The final implementation of the project will showcase your abilities to operationalize production microservices.**

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 and activate it. Refer to this link for help on specifying the Python version in the virtualenv. 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# You should have Python 3.7 available in your host. 
# Check the Python path using `which python3`
# Use a command similar to this one:
python3 -m virtualenv --python=<path-to-Python3.7> .devops
source .devops/bin/activate
```
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
* Create Flask app in Container
* Run via kubectl

**Instructions:**
Task 1: Complete the Dockerfile
	1. dockerfile was completed and tested (make lint) using instructions given. I have used example given during the course to build the docker file.

Task 2: Run a Container & Make a Prediction
	1. run_docker.sh was updated before running. To build docker image and run flask app
		Successfully built a8907e3bce2f
		Successfully tagged apip:latest
	2. ./run_docker.sh was executed and in parallel make_prediction.sh exectuted in another terminal to make prediction.

Task 3: Improve Logging & Save Output

	1. app.py was updated to discplay prdiction as well.
	2.image was built with tag.
	3../run_docker.sh was executed and in parallel make_prediction.sh exectuted in another terminal to make 	improved prediction.
	4.results are captured in docker_out.txt file.

Task 4: Upload the Docker Image
  1. upload_docker.sh was updated using the insturction given and examples used in course.
  2. upload_docker.sh executed to push the docker image to docker hub.
  
Task 5: Configure Kubernetes to Run Locally
  1. Mini Kube was started using "minikube start"
  2. "Minikube kubectl" config view was used to view certificate authority and server:
   certificate-authority: /home/ec2-user/.minikube/ca.crt
    extensions:
    - extension:
        last-update: Tue, 04 Jan 2022 14:59:23 UTC
        provider: minikube.sigs.k8s.io
        version: v1.24.0
      name: cluster_info
    server: https://192.168.49.2:8443
  name: minikube

Task 6: Deploy with Kubernetes and Save Output Logs
  1. run_kubernetes.sh was updated using the instructions given and examples demonstrated.
  2. run_kubernetes.sh was executed first time 
  3. "kubectl get pod" was executed to check status of pod.
  4.   ./run_kuberenets.sh was executed again after checking pod status "Running".
  5.   ./make_prediction.sh was executed from separate terminal.
  6.   Output was saved in "DevOps_Microservice/output_txt_files/kubernetes_out.txt"
      NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
